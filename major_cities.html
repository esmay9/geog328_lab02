    <b>Major Cities</b>
        <br>
        <br>
    <b>Yaoundé</b> 
        <br>
        The capital city of Cameroon is <i>Yaoundé</i>,
        which is located in the central part of the country, <br>
        up in the mountains. Yaoundé is known as the <i>city of seven hills</i> 
        because of its topography, though a more accurate number might be <br>
        in the hundreds, a fact that leads to marvelous tropical vistas 
        around every corner of the city.

        <br>
    <b>Douala</b>
        <br>
        Cameroon's largest city is <i>Douala</i>, 
        located on the delta of the Wouri River as it flows out to the Atlantic. <br>
        It is a lot more humid than its mountainous counterpart, making the city 
        feel much hotter in the dry season, which runs from November to May. <br>
        Many travel sites describe the city as <i>icky and sticky</i> for this reason. 
        Though the city is very flat, on a perfectly clear day, <br>
        Mount Cameroon can be spotted in the distance.
