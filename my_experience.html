    <b>My Experience</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        During 2021-22, I spent a total of 15 months in Cameroon 
        on a proselyting mission for my Church. I spent 6 months <br>
        in Yaound√©, followed by 9 months in Douala. I got to live 
        and work in these two cities and act like a local - ride the taxis, <br> 
        buy the fresh market produce, and speak the language. 
        It was an amazing experience and I'd like to return someday.
